            <p>When you say you feel depressed, on many occasions you
                mean that you feel blue or feel low because something is worrying you.
                Most of us can feel sad sometimes, but this does not mean you have
                depression. Depression is feeling that way, but much more strongly and for a longer
                period of time in a way that interferes with your daily functioning and prevents you
                from enjoying the things you used to enjoy.
                Depression is a mental health disorder. This means that depression is an illness.
                Both brain and body will be affected by this illness. However,
                it is important to keep in mind that depression is treatable. </p>
                <p>Just think about it: do you feel different lately, more gloomy and anxious?
                    Has something recently distressed you? If so, maybe the feeling of sadness is a reaction to your situation.
                        Or do you feel moody, worried, sad in a way that is stopping you from living the way you used to live?
                    Has this been happening for a longer period than a fortnight now? If so, you should fill in the test on
                    this website and maybe look for medical help to be sure you are not suffering from depression.
                        Depression is very common; in fact it is one of the most common mental health problems.
                    One in four or five individuals will experience depression at some stage in their lives. Sometimes
                    depression occurs for no apparent reason. When there is a clear-cut problem and people solve it, or when they come to terms with their situation, or find support, the symptoms associated with depression may ease but in most cases they do not disappear without treatment.
                        When depression is present, people have signs and symptoms but they might not be aware of this.
                    They may only start to sense that they have a serious problem when they just cannot get rid of it, when it begins to have a negative effect on the person's ability to perform their daily activities, or when it becomes so severe that life seems pointless. </p>

            <section>
            <p>In contrast to mental distress in reaction to life events
                , mental disorders such as depression are less common and may occur with or without any obvious cause.
                Mental disorders may be severe and long lasting, and can affect a person's daily life. In such cases,
                it is likely that a person will need professional help. It is important that an accurate medical diagnosis
                is determined and that special interventions such as medication or psychological treatments are put in place.</p>

            <p> Depression is a clinical term describing a medical condition that affects the way mood is controlled by the brain
                – a mood disorder. Depression affects feelings, thoughts and body functions. Experiencing depression involves
                intense negative emotions and feelings and loss of interest, fatigue, change in sleep, sexual activity and weight
                or appetite, negative ideas such as pessimism, low self-esteem, indecisiveness and suicidal ideation, and other
                specific symptoms. On the whole, these symptoms will produce an undesirable effect on people's lives, for example
                impacting on personal wellbeing, work and relationships</p>.

                <h3> How is depression diagnosed?</h3>
            </header>
           <section>
            <p> A diagnosis is a medical label that clarifies the course of the illness and implications for treatment.
                Throughout the world, different systems of disease classifications are used for diagnoses.
                In Europe, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) of the World Health Organisation 10th revision is the most common.
                According to this classification, the diagnosis "depressive disorder" or "
                depressive episode" is made when a certain number of typical symptoms are present over a
                period of at least 2 weeks:</p>
               <p>At least two of the main core symptoms and two of the additional symptoms from the image below:
                Depending on the number and intensity of the symptoms, mild, moderate and severe depression grades are distinguished.
                In case suicidal thoughts occur, it is highly recommended that patients and/or relatives discuss this
                   immediately with their doctor or arrange professional help. It is important to know that this is
                   a symptom of the illness, not a conscious wish and that a person is unlikely to continue
                   to feel this way if they receive the appropriate support.</p>

           <article id="Subtypes_Of_Depression">
            <header>
                <h3> What are the subtypes of depression?</h3>
           </header>
            <section>
                <h5> 1. Depressive episode </h5>
                <br/>
            <p>  The most common and typical form of depression is the depressive episode.
                An episode can start rapidly within few days or slowly over several weeks and
                typically has a duration of several weeks and months. A number of depressive symptoms have to be
                present permanently for at least 2 weeks in order to be able to speak of a depressive episode.
                The majority of people experiencing a depressive episode will have further episodes in their life
                (recurrent depressive disorder). This risk of recurrence can be reduced by an appropriate treatment.</p>
             <h5> 2. Dysthymia</h5> <br/>
                <p> Dysthymia is characterised by milder severity of depressive symptomatology
                    compared to depressive episodes or recurrent depressive disorder. However,
                    the disorder starts mostly during adolescence and is persistent with symptoms
                    lasting at least 2 years, sometimes decades. People suffering from this type of depression
                    sometimes suffer additionally from depressive episodes. In this case with dysthymia and depressive
                    episodes the diagnosis is double depression.</p>
             <h5> 3. Bipolar depression</h5> <br/>
                <p> <b> Bipolar I: </b>  I patients suffer from both depressive and manic episodes.
                    The manic episodes can suddenly occur after several depressive episodes
                    and the original diagnosis of unipolar depression has to be changed to bipolar
                    affective disorder. This change in mood state can occur very rapidly (switch over night)
                    after a depressive episode or after months and years of an healthy mood state. Manic phases
                    are characterized by excessive high mood, connected with hyperactivity, restlessness, irritability,
                    talkativeness and reduced need for sleep..</p>
                <p> Mania affects thinking, judgment, and social behaviour causing serious
                    problems and difficulties. Indiscriminate or unsafe sexual practices or
                    unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is
                    in a manic phase.The best way to describe this alternating "turmoil of e</p>motions" is "going
                    from being on top of the world to the depths of despair".

                    <p> <b> Bipolar II: </b> If the manic symptoms are less pronounced and do not
                lead to major psychosocial problems, not a manic but hypomanic episode
                is diagnosed. If a patient suffers from both depressive and hypomanic
                episodes a bipolar II disorder is diagnosed. Sometimes the hypomanic
                episode occurs immediately after the end of a depressive episode.</p>
                <h5> 4. Psychotic depression</h5> <br/>
                <p> A special form of depressive episode is psychotic or delusional depression.
                    Psychotic depression is characterized by false ideas and convictions (delusions)
                    and sometimes also by hallucinations. The delusions have typically centered around
                    grossly exaggerated feelings of guilt (e.g. “I am only a burden for my family” or “I have made
                    a terrible mistake”), around the fear of complete financial ruin (delusion of poverty) or
                    around exaggerated fear of incurable severe disease (hypochondriac delusion). Delusions
                    typically exist even if there is evidence of the contrary (e.g. enough money available).
                    Patients with psychotic depression almost always need psychiatric inpatient treatment because of
                    the severity of this disorder and the very high suicide risk. Psychotic depression can occur in
                    both unipolar and bipolar depression.</p>
                    <h5> 5. Atypical depression</h5> <br/>
                <p> Patients with this type of depression have the same depressive symptoms as
                    those with typical depression with two exceptions: whereas in typical
                    depression patients have a lack of appetite (often with loss of weight)
                    and difficulties to fall asleep, patients with atypical depression show
                    overeating and oversleeping. This type of depression can occur in unipolar
                    and bipolar depression.</p>
                <h5> 7. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</h5> <br/>
                <p> Patients with SAD show the atypical symptoms
                    described in atypical depression and in addition suffer
                    from this kind of depression only during a certain season of the year,
                    in most cases during autumn and winter. Usually, when the depression season ends,
                    people get well and regain normal functioning again.</p>

        <article id="Brain_Function_In_Depression">
            <header>
                <h3> How does the brain function?</h3>
            </header>
            <section>
          <ol>
                 <li>thinking or cognition </li>
                <li> perception or sensing </li>
                <li> emotional or feeling regulation </li>
                <li> signalling or being responsive and reacting to the environment </li>
                <li> physical or somatic regulation </li>
                <li> behaviour or social regulation </li>
            </ol>
        <p>When the brain is not working adequately, one or more of these functions will be
            impaired and this will become clear through specific signs and symptoms. At the core of depression,
            emotional regulation is affected, but all the other functions reveal difficulties through symptoms.
            All emotions, mood changes, thoughts, perceptions and behaviours are connected with the activity of nerve
            cells in our brain. The brain consists of more than 1 billion nerve cells (neurons) organised in complex neural
            networks. Information is transmitted as if it is electricity from the end of each neuron to the next neuron (synapses).
            The neurons are not directly next to each other. There is a gap between these two neurons (synaptic cleft),
            which is bridged by messaging units or "neurotransmitters".</p>
                <p>
               If an electric signal arrives at the end of a nerve cell, it will cause the release of neurotransmitters
                    into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters, which will be picked up by the neighbouring neuron,
                    cause the following neuron to electrically pass this information. Also, new connections between neurons are
                    regularly established and the existing connections are maintained through the help of hormones produced within the brain (brain derived neurotrophic factor- BDNF).
               A healthy brain has adequate levels of BDNF and constantly makes new neuron connections.
                    It is as if information pathways are being constantly built and repaired. It is in these pathways that
                    electric signs will result in different emotions, thoughts and behaviours.
              A mental disorder diagnosis may be appropriate when the brain is functioning below a
                    certain level of adequacy and signs and symptoms  lead to significant functional
                    impairment in a person’s usual way of living with oneself, with others, family, friends, at school or work.</p>

                <h3> What is the public health significance of depression?</h3>
            </header>
            <section>
            <p>Depression is very common. Around 20 million European citizens suffer from depression each year (WHO, 2008).
                According to the World Health Organisation, depression is one of the most disabling disorders in the world,
                affecting roughly one in five women and one in ten men at some point in their lifetime. Each year, in Europe,
                it is estimated that 7% of people experience an episode of depression. In Europe, a third of all disease costs
                pertain to central nervous system disorders and half of these involve depression.
            </p>
             <p>   Depression can affect anyone. Men and women of all age groups, educational level,
                and social and economic status suffer from depression. All the areas of life are
                impacted when depression is present. Family, parenting, marriage, dating, making
                friends, work, studying, careers, and finances: all aspects of daily living are compromised
                by the presence of depression. Depression often recurs after a first episode and can become
                persistent or chronic if left undiagnosed and untreated.</p>

                <p> But the picture can be even more severe when depression occurs
                    in combination with other medical illnesses such as cancer, diabetes,
                    arthritis, stroke, or cardiovascular disease, or with psychiatric related disorders
                    such as anxiety or substance abuse.
                    A substantial number of depressed people die by suicide and many
                    more engage in non-fatal self-harm behaviour. In the European Member
                    States alone, each year 60,000 people die by suicide and more than half were depressed.</p>

                 <h5> Triggering or precipitating factors</h5> <br/>
            <p> The short-term triggers of a depression can also be seen as two sides of a coin.
                Examples for acute triggers on the psychosocial level can be the loss of a loved one,
                relationship conflicts or changes in a life situation. Also positive life changing events such as
                a change of residence or passing a test can trigger a depression episode. At the neurobiological
                level changes in specific hormones, like stress hormones (cortisol) can be possible triggers..</p>

                 <h5> Vulnerability and resilience factors</h5> <br/>
                <p> Both psychosocial and neurobiological factors can be responsible for an increased vulnerability
                    to a disorder. Childhood traumatic experiences or abuse are psychosocial factors,
                    which can play a part in the later development of a disorder whereas a caring
                    and stable childhood environment will be protective. It is also known, that inherited genetic
                    factors share an influence on increasing vulnerability or the opposite, creating resilience.
                    For instance, they can decrease or increase
                    the proportion of neurotransmitters in the brain and so increase or decrease the risk for a disorder.</p>

         <h5> Maintenance and resolution factors </h5> <br/>
         <p> Long-standing psychosocial difficulties can add to the maintenance in
             depression whereas adequate and intensive social support and therapy can
             lead to a faster resolution of the disorder.</p>

                <h5> Interaction of factors</h5>
                <p> Often there is an interaction between factors involved in increased vulnerability for the disorder,
                    triggering depression and in its maintenance. It is also possible that a depressive episode occurs
                    without any noticeable psychosocial or neurobiological triggers, with no apparent cause, "out of the blue".</p>

                 <p> You might be feeling unwell and do not know if you need treatment or not.
                     To see if you may be in need of treatment, you can complete the self-test that
                     can be accessed in the box "Self-Management Resources" at the top of the page.
                     If you are a family member of someone who might be experiencing depression,
                     you can take the quiz here.  If the test suggests that you could benefit from help,
                     we recommend that you contact your GP to arrange a more in-depth assessment.
                     Either your GP will state that you do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression,
                     or he/she will confirm the diagnosis of depression or another diagnosis.
                     If your doctor prescribes medication, make sure that you completely understand his/her instructions.
                     As with other medications, it is important to follow the doctor's instructions carefully in order to
                     achieve the best possible treatment results.  You can find more detailed information about depression

                    <ol>
                        <li>Your GP might state that they do not feel comfortable either
                            in diagnosing or treating you for mental health issues because
                            it may be outside their area of expertise; he/she may then refer you to a mental health professional</li>
                        <li>Likewise, if you feel that your GP is not specialised enough in the area of mental health,
                            you could ask for referral to a mental health professional, such as a clinical psychologist or
                            psychiatrist</li>
                        <li>If you already have a diagnosed depressive disorder and you are on medication prescribed by your GP,
                            you may be referred for psychotherapy</li>
                        <li>If your GP is not certain whether medication needs to be prescribed,
                            he/she may refer you to a psychiatrist</li>
                        <li>If you are suffering from very severe depression and are in immediate danger of harming yourself or
                            someone else, you may be admitted to inpatient mental health care.</li>

                    <h3> What type of psychotherapy should I chose?</h3>

            <section>
                    <h5> </h5>
                <p> It is helpful to know that "the best" psychotherapy does not exist.
                    When choosing a type of psychotherapy, one thing to consider should be whether it has been
                    found to be effective. CBT and some types of psychodynamic psychotherapy have been found to be effective,
                    and MBCT may prevent relapse in people with recurring depression.
                    However, there are other points to think about. Independent of the type of psychotherapy,
                    the relationship that is developed in the first
                    few sessions between the patient and the therapist is very important. If an "alliance" develops,
                    this good relationship will be vital for the success of the therapy.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What types of therapy are available in my area?</li>
                     <li>When is the right time to start therapy?</li>
                    <li> Is there an available space? If not, how long do I have to wait?</li>
                    <li> How will I pay for the treatment?</li>
                    <li> Can I imagine really engaging in this type of therapy?</li>

            </header>
            <section>
                <p> As well as medication and individual therapy, people with depression may benefit
                    from social interventions. Such interventions may be enough for those with mild depression,
                    but people experiencing moderate or severe depression may need a more intensive approach
                    including medication and therapy.
                    Support groups can teach new skills, encourage healthy activities,
                    and provide social support. There is scientific evidence that group physica
                    l activity programmes can be helpful in reducing mild depression. Also, group-based peer support,
                    CBT programmes, or psychoeducation courses can be very helpful. Voluntary groups focussing
                    on depression often offer these at low cost.
                    More general courses offered in the community (such as "Personal development", "Stress Management"
                    or "Life Skills" courses) may provide new skills and social support. You can find
                    information about depression support groups in the "Get help" section or by asking
                    your GP about relevant services in your area.</p>

                <li>Medical treatments can include not only medication but also other
                    treatment options that are usually only applied in specialised centres.</li>
                <li>Psychological treatment refers to psychotherapy or "talking therapy",
                    which has several theoretical and clinical subtypes. Psychotherapy can
                    be used on its own for less severe forms of depression or in combination with
                    medication for more severe depression.</li>
                <li>Social and other interventions are also very important.
                    These include social activities, relaxation strategies, moderate regular exercise,
                    medical leave (if necessary), learning about the illness and how to engage in self-help.
                    These activities can help to promote hope and empowerment that add to the therapeutic effect
                    of both medication and psychotherapy.</li>
